Vagrant Setup
=============

This is a simple script to convert a qcow2 ostree image to a Vagrant image.
You should be able to run the setup script and it will copy the qcow2 image,
crack it open and add the required users and SSH setup for Vagrant.  It will
then use the templates in this project for the libvirt provider defaults
and package everything up as a Vagrant box that you can import.
